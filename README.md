#### Goal
In this project I implemented Linear Regression with Gradient descent.  
#### Motivation
The motivation was to understand and create functions to compute  
Cost Function with a single variable,  
Gradien Descent with a single variable,  
Cost Function with multiple variables,  
Gradien Descent with multiple variables,  
Feature Normalization.
